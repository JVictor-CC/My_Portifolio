## Introduction

Hello, I'm Jo√£o Victor, a Computer Science student. I'm about to graduate from the Federal Fluminense University and I have been developing my skills in communication, collaboration, and primarily programming.

During my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to exploring various areas of computer science, such as programming, networking, AI, and information security. I always strive to stay updated on trends and innovations by participating in bootcamps, taking online courses, and working on projects that contribute to my learning.

Currently, I am leaning towards the web development field, specifically focusing on Front-end with React and enhancing my Back-end skills with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Additionally, I also have experience with other languages such as Python and R, primarily for data analysis and machine learning.

My goal is to leverage my knowledge to contribute to the creation of technological solutions that can make a positive impact. I am actively seeking opportunities to work on challenging projects that allow me to apply my skills in practice.
